Spl
===

A Compiler for the Shakespeare Programming Language Written in Python. Compiles from SPL to C.

This compiler implements most features of the Shakespeare Programming language described at
http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/

The following features have yet to be or may never be implemented:

- Stacks (because who needs data structures in shakespeare, really?)
- multiple-word nouns in cases where using just the last word would generate any confusion
- Restriction of variable names to Shakespearean characters.
- Enforcement of proper scene numberng.
- Support variable declarations that go across multiple lines, but that won't be too hard to add later.

This is the first release, some of these issues may be fixed in later releases. Also, the following are
features not in the original Shakespeare specification that I plan to add:

- Support for act/scene names in goto statements, so that one can write "let us return to the talk in the forest"
  instead of "let us return to scene II" for instance.
- Support for word replaces of functions: If the goal of Shakespeare i to make programs look like plays, then it
  is sub-optimal having to use words like "square root" all over the place, so I may add a way to define equivalent
  words for math functions in a text file.

To use spl, simply run

$ ./spl [Input File]

Or, if you would like, you can run

$ python splc.py [Input File] > [Output File]
$ gcc [Output File] -lm
$ ./a.out

The spl script should work in any bash terminal, on Windows, the explicit python method should work if you have
all of the right programs installed (other than ./a.out, I think on windows you would just type a.out)

Depenencies:
Python
gcc
