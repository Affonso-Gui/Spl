Spl
===

 Shakespeare Compiler written in Python, splc.py
This is a compiler from SPL to C that implements the majority of the Shakespeare programming
language invented by Kalle Hasselstrom and Jon Aslund, I take no credit for inventing the language.
This software is free to edit or use, and though I doubt anyone would use this for many projects,
I guess I would appreciate some degree of acknowledgment if you do.

This compiler implements most features of the Shakespeare Programming language described at
http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/

The following features have yet to be or may never be implemented:

- Stacks (because who needs data structures in Shakespeare, really?)
- multiple-word nouns in cases where using just the last word would generate any confusion
- Enforcement of proper scene numberng.

The following are planned features not in the original language spec that may be implemented in
later versions of this compiler

- Support for act/scene names in goto statements, so that one can write "let us return to the talk in the forest"
  instead of "let us return to scene II" for instance.
- Support for word replaces of functions: If the goal of Shakespeare is to make programs look like plays, then it
  is sub-optimal having to use words like "square root" all over the place, so I may add a way to define equivalent
  words for math functions in a text file.
- A smarter command line script with flags to name output files, etc.

To use spl, simply run

$ ./spl [Input File]
$ ./a.out

Or, if you would like, you can run

$ python2 splc.py [Input File] > [Output File]
$ gcc [Output File] -lm
$ ./a.out

The spl script should work in any bash terminal, on Windows, the explicit python method should work if you have
all of the right programs installed (other than ./a.out, I think on windows you would just type a.out)

Depenencies:
Python 2.X
gcc
